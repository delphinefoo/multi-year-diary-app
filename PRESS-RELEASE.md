There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Five Year Diary

## Sub-Heading ##
  The market for this app is busy women ages 20 and up who want to record daily memories but don't have time to write a ton of stuff.

## Summary ##
  The Five Year Diary app reminds you where you were and what you were doing over the past few years by storing entries that you write about your day in a few short sentences. When you go to the page for today's date to create a new entry, entries for  the same date in previous years are displayed as well, so you can reflect back on how far you've come since then, or the awesome memories from those past years.

## Problem ##
  Many people have a hard time remembering exactly what date specific events occurred: Did I take my vacation in July or August 3 years ago? What was the name of that  restaurant we went to for my birthday in 2011? It can also be a great source of enjoyment to think about the memories you've built up over the past years. The Multi Year Diary app lets you quickly review what was going on in your life in the last few years, at the end of each day. This can also be a great motivator in goal-setting and achievement!

## Solution ##
  The Five Year Diary app stores entries that you write each day. You will be presented with a blank form to write what you wish on each day. If you've written entries for the same date in any of the previous years, they will be displayed on the same page as today's date. You're limited to 140 characters, so record the most memorable things that stand out to you about each day.

## Quote from You ##
  "We aim to bring more daily joy to our customers' lives and help them achieve goals by enabling them  to record in a few sentences what was happening each day of each year, and then easily review those recordings each day."

## How to Get Started ##
  Sign up for a free account, and start by writing an entry for what you did today. You will be able to delete an entry as long as it's the still the same date you wrote it; otherwise, it's in existence forever! Use the datepicker at the bottom of the screen to look back at entries on specific dates.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I love looking back at my previous entries and remembering the fun things I was doing in the past years! I can use the diary to keep track of my progress toward long-term goals, and see in a concrete way how far I've come in past weeks, months and years."
