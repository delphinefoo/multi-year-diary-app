The Five Year Diary app reminds you where you were and what you were doing over the past few years by storing entries that you write about your day in a few short sentences. When you go to the page for today's date to create a new entry, entries for  the same date in previous years are displayed as well, so you can reflect back on how far you've come since then, or the awesome memories from those past years.
